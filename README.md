npm install
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

## How Multiplayer Works

### Creating a Game
1. Click "Play with Friends" from the main menu
2. Click "Create Room" - you'll get a 6-digit room code
3. Share this code with your friend
4. Game starts automatically when both players join

### Joining a Game
1. Click "Play with Friends" from the main menu
2. Enter the room code your friend shared
3. Click "Join Room"
4. Game starts automatically when both players are ready
